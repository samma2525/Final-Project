This is a game done for a final project while trying to unity, I used some AI while writing the code to understand some functions better, but expect that everything is done by me1 
The assest are free sourced from the internet, I tried drawing but it was awful so I just did some clues
**Game Intro**
You detective Sarah, try to find the three missing keys in the town but then you discover a weird clue when you find one of the keys..

This is a major information about the game, it might have some exposeres so I recommend to play first then read this!!
This game is a mix etween 2D platformer style and top-down style, whic starts with top-down and when the player enters the cave it have like this teleporting thingy that got him into 2D platformer word!

**How to pass the game**
you need to find the two houses that you can onlu enter and press on anything in them trying to find the key without dying from running ghosts, after you find the 3 keys (2 in 2 different houses, one in the main map) you enter the cave and finish the 2D platfromer game, and that it! you finished chapter 1 (and the only chapter right now) in the game!
